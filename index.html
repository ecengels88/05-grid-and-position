Estoy muy orgulloso en lo que he aprendido sobre el terminal y como se use. Me siento muy cómodo usándolo con el idioma Git. Necesito enfocarme en las sistemas de cuadrículas y cuantos contenedores debo poner en mi HTML para ser exitoso.</p>

              <p class="card-body__content">Over the first few assignments I learned a lot about the syntax of HTML and CSS, as well as how they come together to lay out a webpage. Additionally, I learned that using CSS to make grids is the basis of most all website layouts. It helps to blot out the content in each of the classes so that you are not focusing on the content of the divs, but the divs themselves.  </p>

              <p class="card-body__content">Another thing that I have learned over the past few assignments is how to work and collaborate with others. There have been too many times where I have encountered a problem and sought help. More often than not someone else has had the same problem and has helped clarify what I need to do to fix said problem. This process works both ways, as I can recall a few times being able to help others with various problems that I've encountered. Even for things as simple as a missing semicolon, it's always helpful to have an extra set of eyes around to catch problems before they occur.</p>

              <p class="card-body__content">It would be easy to name the things I've learned since day 1 of The Iron Yard. I have literally learned something new everyday; but, perhaps the most monumental thing is that I need to feel comfortable learning new material. There is so much to know in the world of tech, and at the pace of technology there is no way to keep up with it. There will always be something new to learn, there will always be somebody who knows more than you or who does certain things better than you, but as long as that doesn't stop you and you can keep learning from your mistakes, then the world of tech can be extremely fulfilling.</p>
